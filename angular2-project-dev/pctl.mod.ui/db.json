CenturyLink supports SD-WAN managed service via CenturyLink internally-deployed sets of diverse network controllers (collectively “Controller”) and a password-protected management portal (“Management Portal”). The Controller provides an entry point for the customer locations by authenticating the site and assisting to establish a secure channel between customer locations. The Management Portal provides centralized configuration and management via a single pane for all customer locations. Customer understands and agrees that SD-WAN Service is not eligible for any CenturyLink service level agreements.<br> <h4>3.2SD-WAN Service options.</h4>The SD-WAN features are described below.
