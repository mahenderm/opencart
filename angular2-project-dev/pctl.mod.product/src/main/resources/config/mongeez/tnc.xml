however, starting three months after the Effective Date, Customer&apos;s aggregate Contributory Charges must equal or exceed the Revenue Commitment during each Measurement Period.Customer authorizes CenturyLink, its Affiliates, or its agents to use billing information to measure Customer&apos;s Revenue Commitment.If Customer fails to meet its Revenue Commitment, Customer must pay CenturyLink a Shortfall charge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.Rates.&lt;/h4&gt;Unless specified otherwise in a Service Exhibit, Services will receive the applicable rates specified in a Service Exhibit, valid Order Form, or CenturyLink-approved quote form, for the duration of the Initial Term.CenturyLink reserves the right to modify rates after the conclusion of each Service&apos;s minimum service period upon not less than 30 days&apos; prior written notice to Customer; provided that CenturyLink may reduce the foregoing notice period or modify rates or discounts prior to the conclusion of the minimum service period, as necessary, if such modification is based upon Regulatory Activity.CenturyLink also reserves the right to modify rates when the Agreement renews to the rates that are in effect at that time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5.Payment.&lt;/h4&gt;CenturyLink may begin invoicing for specific Services as specified in the applicable Service Exhibit.

In addition to payment of charges for Services, Customer must also pay CenturyLink any applicable Taxes assessed in connection with Services. Taxes may vary and are subject to change.Customer may access its invoices and choose paperless invoices online through CenturyLink Control Center located at controlcenter.centurylink.com.If Customer does not choose paperless invoices through Control Center, CenturyLink may in its discretion assess a $15 MRC for each full paper invoice provided to Customer or a $2 MRC for each summary/remit only (where available) paper invoice provided to Customer.Those charges will not apply to an invoice that is not available through Control Center.Customer&apos;s payments to CenturyLink must be in the form of electronic funds transfer (via wire transfer or ACH), cash payments (via previously-approved CenturyLink processes only), or paper check.CenturyLink reserves the right to charge administrative fees when Customer&apos;s payment preferences deviate from CenturyLink&apos;s standard practices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6.Confidentiality.&lt;/h4&gt;Neither party will, without the prior written consent of the other party: (a) disclose any of the terms of the Agreement; or (b) disclose or use (except as expressly permitted by, or required to achieve the purposes of, the Agreement) the Confidential Information of the other party. Each party will use reasonable efforts to protect the other&apos;s Confidential Information, and will use at least the same efforts to protect such Confidential Information as the party would use to protect its own. CenturyLink&apos;s consent may only be given by its Legal Department.A party may disclose Confidential Information if required to do so by a governmental agency, by operation of law, or if necessary in any proceeding to establish rights or obligations under the Agreement. CenturyLink will not be deemed to have accessed, received, or be in the possession of Customer Confidential Information solely by virtue of the fact that Customer transmits, receives, accesses or stores such information through its use of CenturyLink&apos;s Services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7.CPNI.&lt;/h4&gt;CenturyLink is required by law to treat CPNI confidentially. Customer agrees that CenturyLink may share CPNI within its business operations (e.g., wireless, local, long distance, and broadband services divisions), and with businesses acting on CenturyLink&apos;s behalf, to determine if Customer could benefit from the wide variety of CenturyLink products and services, and in its marketing and sales activities.Customer may withdraw its authorization at any time by informing CenturyLink in writing.Customer&apos;s decision regarding CenturyLink&apos;s use of CPNI will not affect the quality of service CenturyLink provides Customer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8.Use of Name and Marks.&lt;/h4&gt; Neither party will use the name or marks of the other party or any of its Affiliates for any purpose without the other party&apos;s prior written consent.CenturyLink&apos;s consent may only be given by its Legal Department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;9.Disclaimer of Warranties.&lt;/h4&gt;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT, ALL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED \&quot;AS IS.\&quot; CENTURYLINK DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Customer will also defend and indemnify CenturyLink, its Affiliates, agents, and contractors against all third party claims for damages, liabilities, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, related to the modification or resale of the Services by Customer or End Users, or any AUP violation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;h4&gt;12.Termination.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;12.1Service.&lt;/h4&gt;Either party may terminate an individual Service or a Service Exhibit: (a) in accordance with the individual Service Exhibit&apos;s term requirements with 60 days&apos; prior written notice to the other party or (b) for Cause. If Service or a Service Exhibit is terminated by Customer for Convenience or by CenturyLink for Cause, then Customer will pay Cancellation Charges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;12.2Agreement.&lt;/h4&gt;Either party may terminate the Agreement and all Services by: (a) providing written notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the Agreement at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then current Term or (b) for Cause.Cause to terminate an individual Service Exhibit will not constitute Cause to terminate the Agreement; rather, Cause to terminate the entire Agreement for Service-related claims will exist only if Customer has Cause to terminate all or substantially all of the Services under the applicable SLA, Service Exhibit, RSS or Tariff.If the Agreement is terminated by Customer for Convenience or by CenturyLink for Cause prior to the conclusion of the Term, then Customer will pay the higher of: (c) the Early Termination Charge or (d) the total Cancellation Charges that apply for terminating all CenturyLink Services at the time the Agreement is terminated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;12.3Unpaid Charges.&lt;/h4&gt;Customer will remain liable for charges accrued but unpaid as of the termination date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13.Miscellaneous.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;h4&gt;13.1General.&lt;/h4&gt;The Agreement&apos;s benefits do not extend to any third party (e.g., an End User).If any term of the Agreement is held unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain in effect.Except for time requirements as specifically stated in a Service Exhibit or SLA, neither party&apos;s failure to exercise any right or to insist upon strict performance of any provision of the Agreement is a waiver of any right under the Agreement.The terms and conditions of the Agreement regarding confidentiality, indemnification, limitation of liability, warranties, payment, dispute resolution, and all other terms of the Agreement that should by their nature survive the termination of the Agreement will survive.Each party is not responsible for any delay or other failure to perform due to a Force Majeure Event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13.2Conflicts Provision.&lt;/h4&gt;If a conflict exists among provisions within the Agreement, the following order of precedence will apply in descending order of control: Service Exhibit, the Agreement, and any Order Form.If Services are provided pursuant to a Tariff, RSS, or ISS as described in the applicable Service Exhibits, the order of precedence will apply in the following descending order of control:Tariff, Service Exhibit, the Agreement, RSS, ISS, and Order Form.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;h4&gt;13.3Independent Contractor.&lt;/h4&gt; CenturyLink provides the Services as an independent contractor. The Agreement will not create an employer-employee relationship, association, joint venture, partnership, or other form of legal entity or business enterprise between the parties, their agents, employees or affiliates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13.4ARRA.&lt;/h4&gt;Customer will not pay for the Services with funds obtained through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or other similar stimulus grants or loans that would obligate CenturyLink to provide certain information or perform certain functions unless each of those obligations are explicitly identified and agreed to by the parties in the Agreement or in an amendment to the Agreement.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13.5HIPAA.&lt;/h4&gt; CenturyLink does not require or intend to access Customer data in its performance hereunder, including but not limited to any confidential health related information of Customer&apos;s clients, which may include group health plans, that constitutes Protected Health Information (\&quot;PHI\&quot;), as defined in 45 C.F. R. Â§160.103 under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\&quot;HIPAA Rules\&quot;).To the extent that any exposure to PHI is incidental to CenturyLink&apos;s provision of Service and not meant for the purpose of accessing, managing the PHI or creating or manipulating the PHI, such exposure is allowable under 45 CFR 164.502(a)(1)(iii). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13.6Credit Approval.&lt;/h4&gt; Provision of Services is subject to CenturyLink&apos;s credit approval of Customer. As part of the credit approval process, CenturyLink may require Customer to provide a deposit or other security. Additionally during the Term, if Customer&apos;s financial circumstance or payment history becomes reasonably unacceptable to CenturyLink, CenturyLink may require adequate assurance of future payment as a condition of continuing CenturyLink&apos;s provision of Services.
